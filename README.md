# Computer Image Processing
**Computer Image Processing and Graphics - Ã“buda University 2023**

This repository contains the work I completed for the **Computer Image Processing Master Class**. The course focused on theoretical aspects of image processing, with minimal hands-on practice during class sessions. I developed two projects to gain practical experience in applying the concepts learned.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Photoshop Project](https://github.com/Ponti1999/Computer_image_processing/tree/main/Photoshop)
This project is a Python-based application for applying various image filters and transformations with real-time performance monitoring. It was an optional project offered for extra points. Although other students used faster implementations in C or C++, I chose Python to enhance my programming skills and experiment with applying theoretical knowledge. Key features include:

- Image Negation
- Gamma Correction
- Sobel Edge Detection
- Parallel Mean Filtering
- Performance Monitoring

For detailed information and instructions, refer to the [Photoshop Project README](https://github.com/Ponti1999/Computer_image_processing/tree/main/Photoshop).

### 2. [Eye Blink Fatigue Detection Project](https://github.com/Ponti1999/Computer_image_processing/tree/main/Semester_Assignment)
This project was a mandatory semester assignment where students could choose their own topics related to image processing. I chose to implement a fatigue detection program using a webcam to monitor eye blinks and estimate user fatigue levels. The project includes:

- Real-time eye blink detection using OpenCV.
- Fatigue assessment based on blink frequency.
- Basic user interface (UI) built with Tkinter.
- Integration of alerts and counters to monitor user fatigue.

For more details, see the [Eye Blink Fatigue Detection Project README](https://github.com/Ponti1999/Computer_image_processing/tree/main/Semester_Assignment).

## About the Master Class

The **Computer Image Processing Master Class** primarily focused on the theoretical foundations of image processing. Practical exercises were limited, but I applied what we learned by building these projects to gain hands-on experience.
